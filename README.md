# Forest Simulation Project

Welcome to the Forest Simulation Project! This project provides a simulation framework implemented in C++ for modeling and analyzing foresting operations. It allows users to simulate various scenarios, evaluate different parameters, and gain insights into operational efficiency and resource utilization in forestry.

## Overview
- **Purpose:** The Forest Simulation Project aims to model and analyze foresting operations, including project generation, resource allocation, and project completion dynamics.
- **Features:** 
  - Simulate project queues, resource utilization, and project completion times.
  - Analyze performance under different scenarios and parameter configurations.
  - Provides insights into resource management and operational efficiency.

## Key Components
- **Project Generator:** Generates projects with random sizes and compositions.
- **Queue Management:** Manages project queues and simulates project completion.
- **Simulation Orchestrator:** Controls the simulation flow and monitors performance metrics.

## How to Use
1. **Installation:** Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. **Compilation:** Compile the project using a C++ compiler (e.g., g++).
3. **Execution:** Run the compiled executable to start the simulation.
4. **Configuration:** Adjust simulation parameters and settings as needed.
5. **Analysis:** Interpret simulation results and performance metrics.
